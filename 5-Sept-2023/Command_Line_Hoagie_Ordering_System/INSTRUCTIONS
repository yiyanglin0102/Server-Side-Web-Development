Create a hoagie, single-user command-line ordering system.
Using Inquirer.js, if you want -> (https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/tree/master/packages/input),  you can always choose a module that suits you.    The bottom line is that the program works, bug-free and is reliable and completed on-time.

Using the keyboard, build a system that asks the user for their selections (shown below).   When you have completed the order, show the user their final price.   (No taxes are included.)    Do not build a web page.   This is a command line application.
